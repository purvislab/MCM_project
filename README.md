# MCM_project

2019.06.24

This version of tools was developed after a conversation 06/13/2019.

Pipeline:

* create a directory for a set of imaging that shared staining and will share thresholding 
* create subdirectory 'data' and put all the images inside
  * remember that each image should contain only a single cell
  * if it's not a case - the cells should be separated (-> please let me know if we need to accomodate this issue)
* create a csv file (Excel) with the information about cells for analysis (example columns: file_name, cell_age, cell_category, CDK2_activity)
* run
